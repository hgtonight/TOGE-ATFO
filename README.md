=========

A playground for Monogame and collaboration. To prevent pull requests in the group,
everyone is a collaborator that can **do anything** to the repo. Use the branch guide
below to prevent merge conflicts and keep master stable. If you have any questions
about git, google it. If you still have questions or think you really mucked it up,
get in the codezone and ask for help.

### master ###

This is the stable version. Should always compile. Rebase your branch to this before merging feature branches.

### class/x ###

Branch developing specific classes. There should be fewer of these the farther along we get.

### feature/y ###

Branch adding a feature.

### bugfix/z ###

Who am I kidding, we don't commit buggy code.
